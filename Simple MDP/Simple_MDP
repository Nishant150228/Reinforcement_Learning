Overview
This repository contains the implementation of two Markov Decision Process (MDP) scenarios as part of LAB-01 for Reinforcement Learning. These scenarios illustrate the application of MDPs to solve decision-making problems in uncertain environments:

Self-Driving Car at an Intersection
Robot Navigation in a Grid World
Both scenarios are implemented in Python using OpenAI Gym. The solutions include problem formalization, policy definition, implementation, and result interpretation.
